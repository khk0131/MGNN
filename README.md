# MGNN
Hello! MGNN is used for neural network potential based on equivariant graph neural network E(3)-equivariant neural network consisting atom-centered message passing neural networks (MPNNs) can be used for molecular dynamics simulations.<br><br>The model is originated from NequIP(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36329-y) which employs E(3)-equivariant convolutions for interactions of geometric tensors, resulting in a more information-rich and faithful representation of atomic environments.

## Installation
mgnn requires e3nn puckage(https://github.com/e3nn/e3nn)<br>
```bash
git clone git@github.com:khk0131/MGNN.git
```
Then, you can install mgnn in your environment
